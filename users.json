Athena\nprovides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it\nlives. Analyze data or build applications from an Amazon Simple Storage\nService (S3) data lake and 30 data sources, including on-premises data\nsources or other cloud systems using SQL or Python. Athena is built on\nopen-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no\nprovisioning or configuration effort required.\n\n**Amazon EMR** provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast,\nand cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically\nscalable Amazon EC2 instances. With EMR, you can launch a large Trino\ncluster in minutes. You don't need to worry about node provisioning, cluster\nsetup or tuning. Using Trino on EMR provides these benefits to customers:\n\n* Elasticity: With Amazon EMR, you can provision one, hundreds, or\nthousands of compute instances to process data at any scale. You can easily\nincrease or decrease the number of instances manually or with auto scaling,\nand you only pay for what you use.\n* Simple and predictable pricing: You pay a per-second rate for every second\nused, with a one-minute minimum charge.\n",

Using Trino, Valerian was able to reduce millions in\ncloud spend on relational databases for clients by augmenting Trino's use to\nfunction as a relational database on top of Object Storage with\nnear-infinite scalability. By using Trino as both a distributed querying\nengine on top of a unified data lake for AI/ML and Data Analytics as well as\nthe ACID-based transactional database layer of applications, Valerian has\nbeen able to harness Trino to create the future of Data Fabric solutions.\n",
