# Clients

A client is used to send queries to Trino and receive results, or otherwise
interact with Trino and the connected data sources.

Some clients, such as the `command line interface`, can provide a user interface
directly. Clients like the `JDBC driver`, provide a mechanism for other tools to
connect to Trino.

The following clients are available:

  <Card href="/docs/client/jdbc" title="JDBC driver" />
</Cards>

In addition, the community provides
[numerous other clients](https://trino.io/resources.html) for platforms such as
Python, and these can in turn be used to connect applications using these
platforms.
