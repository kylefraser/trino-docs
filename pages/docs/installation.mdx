# Installation

A Trino server can be installed and deployed on a number of different platforms.
Typically you run a cluster of machines with one coordinator and many workers.
You can find instructions for deploying such a cluster, and related information,
in the following sections:

Once you have a completed the deployment, or if you have access to a running
cluster already, you can proceed to configure your `client application`.
